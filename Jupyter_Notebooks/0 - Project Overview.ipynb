    "    \n",
    "- **Photography** is the primary medium to document site conditions. \n",
    "    - If the project is large, then hundreds or thousands of photos can be taken on a single site visit!\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- A selection of these photos is used to generate a **\"field report\".** \n",
    "    - The field report summarizes progress since the last visit and identifies any areas of deficient work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Often times, it is very time-consuming to manually pore through all of the photos taken to find all of the images that capture deficient work.\n",
    "    - This can take a lot of time - and this is time that can be saved by a **Convolutional Neural Network.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- As an immediate use case, across a large architecture/engineering firm, or even a construction company, **this tool would save hundreds to thousands of hours of labor per year, and therefore would save many thousands of dollars.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Further into future, perhaps drones could fly through a construction site, and take photos and auto-identify problem areas using this CNN!"
